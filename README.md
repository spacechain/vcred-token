Virtual Credit VCRED token

## Abstract

Virtual Credit (VCRED) Is a token created by Spacechain (SPC), and managed by a small DAO, for the purposes of having a cryptocurrency that approximates a USD pegged token in vendor payments.

## Specification

VCRED is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain at address **0xE7b982F901B47d6fa21F5d1F3Ad4B64C105060bf**. It is maintained through flows associated with DAO Treasury Management. It is not reserve-backed.
